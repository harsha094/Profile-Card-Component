### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this project I learned how to make different well-structured containers class in HTML, and In CSS I learned how we use its different properties like animation, tranformation, opacity, padding, margin, border etc.

Code snippets, see below:

```html
<body>
  <section class="main">
    <div class="circles">
      <img class="cir1" src="images/bg-pattern-top.svg" alt="">
      <img class="cir2" src="images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg" alt="">
    </div>
  </section>
</body>
```

```css
.circles .cir1,
.circles .cir2{
    position: absolute;
    width: 800px;
    animation: 2s circles forwards;
    opacity: 0;
    
}

.circles .cir1{
    top: -300px;
    left: -175px;
    transform: translate(-100px, -50px);
}

.circles .cir2{
    bottom: -300px;
    right: -175px;
    transform: translate(100px, 50px);
}

@keyframes circles {
    0%{
        opacity: 0;
    }

    100%{
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translate(0);
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on my path to a full stack web developer, i already completed HTML/CSS and JavaScript functionalities and now i'm focusing on remaining onces(React.js, Node.js, Dapps, APIs and Database).


### Useful resources

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped me in using css properties like flex, animation etc. I really liked this platform and will use it going forward.
